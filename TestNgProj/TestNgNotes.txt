Annotations in TestNG
         @BeforeSuite
         @AfterSuite
         @BeforeClass
         @AfterClass
         @Test
         @BeforeTest
         @AfterTest
         @BeforeMethod
         @AfterMethod

@Test: Marks a class or a method as a part of the test.
@BeforeMethod: A method which is marked with this annotation will be executed before every @test annotated method.
@AfterMethod: A method which is marked with this annotation will be executed after every @test annotated method.
@BeforeClass: A method which is marked with this annotation will be executed before first @Test method execution. It runs only once per class.
@AfterClass: A method which is marked with this annotation will be executed after all the test methods in the current class have been run
@BeforeTest: A method which is marked with this annotation will be executed before first @Test annotated method.
@AfterTest: A method which is marked with this annotation will be executed when all @Test annotated methods complete the execution of those classes which are inside <test> tag in testng.xml file.
@BeforeSuite: A method which is marked with this annotation will run only once before all tests in the suite have run
@AfterSuite: A method which is marked with this annotation will run once after execution of all tests in the suite have run
@BeforeGroups: This annotated method will run before the first test run of that specific group.
@AfterGroups: This annotated method will run after all test methods of that group completes its execution.


@Parameters: This annotation is used to pass parameters to test methods.
@DataProvider: If we use @DataProvider annotation for any method that means you are using that method as a data supplier. The configuration of @DataProvider annotated method must be like it always return Object[][] which we can use in @Test annotated method. The @Test method that wants to receive data from this DataProvider needs to use a dataProvider name equals to the name of this annotation.

@Factory: Marks a method as a factory that returns objects that will be used by TestNG as Test classes. The method must return Object[ ].

@Listeners: This annotation is used with test class. It helps in writing logs and results.
