=========== DataTables ===========
Data Tables in Cucumber are quite interesting and can be used in many ways.
DataTables are also used to handle large amounts of data
 
No keyword is used to define the test data
This works only for the single step, below which it is defined
A separate code needs to understand the test data and then it can be run single or multiple times 
but again just for the single step, not for the complete test
