Cucumber Options
-----------------------
1>Dry Run
dryRun option can either set as true or false. If it is set as true, it means that Cucumber will only
check that every Step mentioned in the Feature File has corresponding code 
written in Step Definition file or not.

2)Strict
Set to true. Will fail execution if there are any pending or undefined steps

3)Monochrome
This option can either set as true or false. If it is set as true, it means that the console output for the 
Cucumber test are much more readable. And if it is set as false, then the console output is not as readable
 as it should be. 
 
4)Features
Features Options helps Cucumber to locate the Feature file in the project folder structure. 

5)Glue
It is almost the same think as Features Option but the only difference is that it helps Cucumber to locate the 
Step Definition file.

6)Tags
What tags in the feature file should be executed
